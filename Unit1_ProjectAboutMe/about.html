  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm a senior system integration consultant, living in San Francisco. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I would like to have my own website feed for bloody marys. 

  </p> 

  <h2>My Mission</h2>
  <p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day run my own bloody mary making company. I would like to have my own working website along with a mobile app.</p>

 <h2>My Experience</h2>
 <p>This is how I've evolved professionally:</p>

    	<strong>Technology Consultant</strong>, Accenture<br>
