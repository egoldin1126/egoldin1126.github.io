  <h1>Unit 2 Design Challenge<h2>
  

  <h2>1. Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
  <p>Here is a list of my favorite websites:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://food52.com/"><em>food52.com</em></a>
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://donachai.com/"><em>donachai.com</em></a>
    </li>
  </ul>

 <h2>2. How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
 
 <h3>a) food52.com</h3>
 <p>This website does not have a lot of white space, but it also has a lot of information for the users. Because of this, the site does not waste any space and begs the user to scroll through its content. When the site opens for the users, it has them focus on the big pictures that immediately appear on top of the home page. The website does not have true balance except for the way it displays content hierarchy. The site has the most important content first, then it shows the users other searched content as they scroll down the page. It also has a header that is frozen as you scroll.</p>

 <h3>b) donachai.com</h3>
 <p>This website has a lot of balance horizontally. It fills the white space with different colors or background pictures, which helps to separate the sections on the website. The site has a header that includes the logo, but it does not seem that it is the focal point. Also the header does not drastically stand out compared to other website content. Additionally, the header has links that navigate the users to different sections within the page so he/she does not have to scroll to navigate.  
  

<h2>3. What makes them similar and different?</h2>
 <p>The two sites are <u>similar</u> in the following ways:</p>
 <ul>
    <li>The logos do not appear to be the focal point on the website</li>
    <li>The balance of the website encourages the users to scroll through the content</li>
    <li>The grid layout is not consistent</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The two sites are <u>different</u> in the following ways:</p>
 <ul>
    <li><em>Food52</em> has a lot more content compared to <em>donachai</em></li>
    <li><em>Food52</em> does not separate its horizontal sections with different background colors/pictures compared to <em>donachai</em></li>
    <li><em>Food52</em> has a site header that moves with the users as they navigate. <em>donachai</em> does not have the header follow the user's navigation</li>
  </ul>
